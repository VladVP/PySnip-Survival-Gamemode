IN survival mode, all players are spawned in one team at the starting. Yes, team killing allowed, Players can decide to play solo or form teams(There will be a command for teams
so they can avoid killing their own members at the end game) All the players spawn in the center of the map (sort of like Minecraft Survival games) and are spawn protected for 5
minutes. They start out with A rifle with no bullets, a spade, 0 blocks (NO GREANDES, NO SMG NO SHOTTY) Players have to run out of the center of the map and establish there fortress
To defend themeselves. (THere would be abandoned building in the map to help players out) There will be golded chests in their ways(orange blocks :33) if they destroy them with
their spade they get random rewards. ON killing a player a player gets 5 bullets. I think this much should be enough
